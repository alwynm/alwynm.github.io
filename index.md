I'm a PhD student in Computer Science & Engineering at
[IIT Patna](https://www.iitp.ac.in) under the supervision of 
[Dr. Jimson Mathew](https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php/en-us/people/faculty/2-uncategorised/212-view-profile-23). 
I'm primarily interested in replicating biological visual system 
to a computer system. My current research goal is to build 
learning algorithms that can perceive depth without supervision.

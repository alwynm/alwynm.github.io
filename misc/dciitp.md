### Alpha IITP


IIT Patna has launched its first ever [DC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Direct_Connect) 
network in campus. Users connect to hubs using DC clients, and are able to share files 
with each other at high speeds over intranet (no internet access needed).


>**Alpha IITP** hub intends to provide service to users willing to share 
"legal", "non objectionable" content. However the hub only provides a 
"connectivity layer" and a message board for the users and has no control 
over items shared or posted. The hub takes no responsibility for, does not 
expressly or implicitly endorse, and does not assume any liability for any 
content submitted by the users. The user, and the user alone isâ€© responsible 
for their activity on the hub. By entering into the hub you agree to these 
terms and conditions. The hub scripts are all work of admin and operators 
and all rights regarding it are reserved to respective authors.

#### FAQ


1. Can I connect to DC via web browser?
    
    No, you cant.

2. Can I access DC from a smartphone?
    
    Technically, yes. Some apps like [SharikDC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sharikdc.sharikdc&hl=en_IN) 
    and [AnDCPP](https://apkpure.com/andcpp/com.phinmadvader.andcppV2), 
    claims to be DC clients for android phones, allowing you to connect 
    to a local DC hub through WiFi. But I haven't tested them personally, 
    thus cant guarantee access to DC.

3. Why cant I connect to DC after fresh DC client install?
 
    Make sure you have username(nickname) set in your client. Some DC clients 
    doesnt ask users to set username(nickname) on initial startup. Try to 
    reconnect after setting a valid Username(Nick) manually in your client. 
    File -> Settings(Preferences) -> Personal -> Username(Nick).
    
4. How do I share a directory in my system with DC?

    File >> Settings(Preferences) >> Sharing >> Add

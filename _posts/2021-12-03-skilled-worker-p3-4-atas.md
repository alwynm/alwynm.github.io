[Previous blog](skilled-worker-p3-2-atas) we talked about other 
sections in your ATAS application other than Proposed research section.
ATAS blog is divided into four posts: [Part 3.1](skilled-worker-p3-1-atas) talks about 
ATAS (Academic Technology Approval Scheme) and how to apply ATAS, [Part 3.2](skilled-worker-p3-2-atas) talks about 
proposed research section in your ATAS application , [Part 3.3](skilled-worker-p3-3-atas) talks about other section in 
your ATAS application and Part 3.4(this blog) talks about how long ATAS application takes to be 
approved.

### How long applications take

It will take at least 20 working days (4 full weeks) to process a student 
ATAS application. Processing times will increase between April and September 
and can take 30 or more working days to complete.

It will take at least 10 working days (2 full weeks) to process a researcher 
ATAS application. Processing times will increase between April and September 
and can take 15 or more working days to complete.

To ensure fairness and consistency we process applications in order of receipt. 
There is no ‘fast track’ service. You should submit your ATAS application as 
early as possible.

[Next blog](skilled-worker-p4-cos) in this series brief about Certificates 
of Sponsorship that you will receive from your sponsor.

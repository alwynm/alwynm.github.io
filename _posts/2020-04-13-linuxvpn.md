Virtual Private Network (VPN) extends a private network across a public 
network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public 
networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private 
network.

Steps to follow:

1. Get VPN credentials from institute officals over webmail
    ```
    To: cc [AT] iitp [DOT] ac [DOT] in
    Cc: cc_head [AT] iitp [DOT] ac [DOT] in
    ```

2. Download OpenVPN 2.4.8 from [here](https://www.techspot.com/downloads/downloadnow/5182/?evp=851afc05ae3a528d9f392a9da40bc911&file=5) or [here](https://swupdate.openvpn.org/community/releases/openvpn-2.4.8.tar.gz)

3. Extract files  ```tar xvf openvpn-2.4.8.tar.gz ```

4. Install dependencies

    1. ```sudo apt-get install liblzo2-de```
    2. ```sudo apt-get install libpam0g-dev```
    3. ```sudo apt install libssl1.0 libssl1.0-dev```

5. Run configure. The configure script is responsible for getting ready to 
build the software on your specific system. It makes sure all of the 
dependencies for the rest of the build and install process are available. 
    ```
    cd openvpn-2.4.8
    ./configure
    ```

6. Install 
```sudo make install```

7. Login [IITP SSL VPN portal](https://14.139.194.12:8443/corporate/sslvpnuserportal/login.jsp) to get VPN configuration

8. Click on  "Client Configuration for MAC Tunnelblick" and download VPN configuration

9. Extract configuration 
    ```
    tar xvf clientbundle.tgz
    cd clientbundle/CRSSLconfig.tblk
    ```

10. Run VPN with configuration ```sudo openvpn --config client.ovpn``` and enter your VPN credentials.

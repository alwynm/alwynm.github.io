title: UK Skilled Worker Tier-2 visa Part 1
categories: VISA
ready : true

After being offered a PDRA position in the United Kingdom (UK) I found that applying 
UK VISA was a huge huddle from India. As I went along the visa process I notice that 
I wasted days waiting for some official document to be approved, and not realizing 
that I could move on to prepare other required documents needed for the visa. I hope 
this blog series could help PhD students from India with applying for a skilled worker 
visa as time efficiently as possible.

Firstly, a Skilled work visa is not the only route for skilled jobs in the UK. 
Another very attractive route to the UK is with a 
[Global Talent visa (Tier 1)](https://www.gov.uk/global-talent). But Global Talent 
visa is much difficult to be approved than a Skilled work visa. If you have a 
permanent job, or a contract for more than two years you may be eligible to apply 
for Global Talent visa

A Skilled Worker visa (Tier 2) allows you to come to or stay in the UK to do an eligible 
job with an approved employer. This visa has replaced the formerly called Tier 2 
(General) work visa. The best place to know more about the visa, or the routes to apply 
this visa is the [Official UK Skilled visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa) website. 
Unlike other official websites, UK visa website is clean and well organized.

Once you receive your offer/appointment letter from a UK university/laboratory, you 
can start your visa application. The paper you will need to apply for a Skilled 
worker visa are:

* A valid passport
* Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate
* Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)
* Verified PhD degree certificate via [ECCTIS](https://www.ecctis.com/visasandnationality)
* Proof for English proficiency via [ECCTIS](https://www.ecctis.com/visasandnationality)
* Tuberculosis (TB) screening test report

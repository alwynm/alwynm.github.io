In the previous blog, I listed the documents you will need to apply for Skilled 
Worker (Tier-2) visa. 

You should have a valid passport before applying for any visa. Below are some 
questions for you:

* Passport with expiry date well beyond the visa application date? 
  _If your passport is about to be expired, I would highly recommend renewing for 
  passport to be on the safe side._ 
  
* Details in your passport should match with your certificates and transcripts? 
  _If you have correction to be made to your passport, correct your passport well 
  before you start your passport._ 

* Want to bring your spouse with you?
  _If you are married and  if you would like to bring your spouse with you to UK, 
  I would advise to add your spouses name to your  passport if not already done. 
  This would allow her to apply for dependent visa once your skilled worker visa 
  is approved._ 
  
If you are short of time, you  could use talkal passport vesa service to get in done 
in few days rather than  weeks. It is to be noted that talkal service will cost you 
more than the regular  passport application. Next blog talks about one of the most important document, Academic Technology 
Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate, you should first acquire from UK Foreign, 
Commonwealth & Development Office.

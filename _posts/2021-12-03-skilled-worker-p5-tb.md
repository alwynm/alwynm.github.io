### Tuberculosis (TB) screening test report

You’ll need to have a tuberculosis (TB) test if you’re coming to the UK 
for more than 6 months and are resident in any of these [listed countries](https://www.gov.uk/tb-test-visa/countries-where-you-need-a-tb-test-to-enter-the-uk).
You’ll be given a chest x-ray to test for TB. If the result of the x-ray 
is not clear you may also be asked to give a sputum sample (phlegm coughed 
up from your lungs). If your test shows that you do not have TB, you’ll be given a certificate 
which is valid for 6 months from the date of your x-ray. Include this 
certificate with your UK visa application.

If you are from India, your test must be from a [clinic approved](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tuberculosis-test-for-a-uk-visa-clinics-in-india/tuberculosis-testing-in-india) by the Home Office. VISA office 
will not accept a tuberculosis test certificate from a clinic we have not approved.
This is one of the difficult document to acquire as each state in India have few 
approved hospitals or clinics that perform these test. If you are short in time, 
you should get TB tested soon after you have applied ATAS. TB test will cost you 
around 2000-3000 INR according to the state.

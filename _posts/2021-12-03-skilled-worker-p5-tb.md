[Previous blog](skilled-worker-p4-cos) we talked about Certificates 
of Sponsorship that you will receive from your sponsor. This blog talks 
about Tuberculosis (TB) screening test tha you should provide when applying
the visa.

### Tuberculosis (TB) screening test report

You’ll need to have a tuberculosis (TB) test if you’re coming to the UK 
for more than 6 months and are resident in any of these [listed countries](https://www.gov.uk/tb-test-visa/countries-where-you-need-a-tb-test-to-enter-the-uk).
You’ll be given a chest x-ray to test for TB. If the result of the x-ray 
is not clear you may also be asked to give a sputum sample (phlegm coughed 
up from your lungs). If your test shows that you do not have TB, you’ll be given a certificate 
which is valid for 6 months from the date of your x-ray. Include this 
certificate with your UK visa application.

If you are from India, your test must be from a [clinic approved](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tuberculosis-test-for-a-uk-visa-clinics-in-india/tuberculosis-testing-in-india) by the Home Office. VISA office 
**will not accept a tuberculosis test certificate from a clinic we have not approved**.
This is one of the difficult document to acquire as each state in India have few 
approved hospitals or clinics that perform these test. If you are short in time, 
**you should get TB tested soon after you have applied ATAS**. TB test will cost you 
around 2000-3000 INR according to the location.

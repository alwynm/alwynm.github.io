Tensorboard is one of the best visualization tool to monitor training 
of your deep neural network, regardless of the deep learning library, 
tensorflow or pytorch. If you are working in a server shared by many 
users, you have have faced an issue of denying permission 
to `/tmp/.tensorboard-info` when you try to start your tensorboard. 
This is mainly because of the different tensorboard versions that 
user use. 

The writing of tensorboard info files introduced in 
[#1806](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/pull/1806) caused 
permission problem under multi-user scenario. It directly create 
`.tensorboard-info` directory under `/tmp`. 

#### Solution 1

Find out that owner of `/tmp/.tensorboard-info`
with `stat --format=%U /tmp/.tensorboard-info`. That user - probably
whoever created the directory - can `chmod` it or remove it.

```
sudo chmod 777 /tmp/.tensorboard-info
```

#### Solution 2 (recommended)

Turns out, tensorboard uses `tempfile.tempdir` to get the path to the 
temporary directory (usually `/tmp/`). In this directory the `.tensorboard` 
folder is created. It is possible to specify the temp directory 
returned by `tempfile.tempdir` by setting the environment variable `TMPDIR`.

Now we can simply force tensorboard to use another directory then 
`/tmp/.tensorboard/`, like `/tmp/.<dir-name>/.tensorboard` as below:
```
mkdir /tmp/.<dir-name>
TMPDIR=/tmp/.<dir-name> tensorboard --logdir="/path/to/log/"
```

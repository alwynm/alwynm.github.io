### Certificates of sponsorship 

Certificates of sponsorship (CoS) is provided by the employer as soon as you 
have an approved ATAS certificate if you have a UK degree certificate. 
If you hold an overseas degree (like indian degree) you need to verify 
it with [ECCTIS](https://www.ecctis.com/visasandnationality).

### NARIC reference number

If you hold a non-UK degree, the institute need your NARIC reference 
number to process your sponsorship certificate. Due to the UK leaving 
the European Union, the UK NARIC national agency function naric.org.uk 
is now UK ENIC www.enic.org.uk – managed by ECCTIC www.ecctis.com. 
All services operate as before. Individuals: use this Ecctis website 
to apply for Visas & Nationality and Industry Skills Statements. 

### PhD verification

ECCTIC provide a statement confirming your PhD is comparable to the standard 
of a PhD in the UK. This is the Academic Qualification Level 
Statement (AQUALS). In addition, they will check and confirm if the 
degree is genuine by contacting your institution. For verification, you have 
to provide, Final certificate(s), Transcript(s) and Certified translations 
of your documents, if not in English.

### Proof for English proficiency

If your degree was not studied in a majority English-speaking country, 
we also confirm the level of your English language proficiency based 
on your qualification and according to the Common European Framework 
of Reference for Languages (CEFR). This is the English Language 
Proficiency Statement (ELPS).

If your PhD degree was not taught in English but you have another 
degree which was taught in English, for example, a Bachelor or 
Master’s degree, we may be able to provide the AQUALS and ELPS 
for your Bachelor or Master’s degree, provided that they meet 
the requirements of the service.

For verification, you have  to provide, Final certificate(s), 
Transcript(s), Certified translations of your documents, if 
not in English and Medium of Instruction letter if you need 
to evidence your English language proficiency. Medium of 
Instruction letter is issued by the institute that 
taught your course in English. Ensure you have Medium of 
Instruction letter from your institute even before ATAS.

English proficiency, PhD verification or both, all costs you 
210 pound sterling each. If you are from india, you should 
apply for PhD verification with English proficiency which 
will also cost 210 pound sterling plus tax plus e-copy fee. 
Ensure you are ready with your English proficiency, 
verified PhD degree and NARIC reference number from 
ECCTIS by the time your ATAS is approved.

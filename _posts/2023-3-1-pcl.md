For systems for which we do not offer precompiled binaries, you need to compile Point Cloud Library (PCL) from source.
Here are the steps that you need to take: Go to [Github](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/releases) and download
the version number of your choice. Uncompress the tar-bzip archive, e.g. (replace 1.13.0 with the correct version
number):

{% highlight js %}tar xvfj pcl-pcl-1.13.0.tar.gz
{% endhighlight %}

Change the directory to the pcl-pcl-1.13.0 (replace 1.13. with the correct version number) directory, and create a build
directory in there:

{% highlight js %}cd pcl-pcl-1.13.0 && mkdir build && cd build
{% endhighlight %}

Please note that cmake might default to a debug build. If you want to compile a release build of PCL with enhanced
compiler optimizations, you can change the build target to “Release” with “-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release”:

{% highlight js %}cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, compile everything

{% highlight js %}make -j2
{% endhighlight %}

And install the result:

{% highlight js %}make install
{% endhighlight %}

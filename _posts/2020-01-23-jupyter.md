This will help to configure to access remotely running jupyter notebook from local machine.

To configure you will need jupyter notebook configure file. You can create a jupyter_notebook_config.py file, with all the [defaults](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html) commented out, 
by:

{% highlight js %}
jupyter notebook --generate-config
{% endhighlight %}

By default, Jupyter Notebook only accepts connections from localhost (eg, from 
the same computer that its running on). By modifying the 
NotebookApp.allow_origin option from the default ' ' to '*' in jupyter_notebook_config.py, you allow 
Jupyter to be accessed externally.

{% highlight js %}
c.NotebookApp.allow_origin = '*' #allow all origins
{% endhighlight %}

You'll also need to change the IPs that the notebook will listen on:

{% highlight js %}
c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0' # listen on all IPs
{% endhighlight %}

Launch Jupyter Notebook from remote server using port <port>: 

{% highlight js %}
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=<port>
{% endhighlight %}

Or run the following command to launch with default port: 

{% highlight js %}
jupyter notebook --no-browser
{% endhighlight %}

You can also access the notebook from your remote machine over SSH by 
setting up a SSH tunnel. Run the following command from your local machine: 

{% highlight js %}
ssh -L <port>:localhost:<port> <remote_user>@<remote_host>
{% endhighlight %}

You can decide on runtime with the same result, but without the need for a configuration file

{% highlight js %}
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0
{% endhighlight %}

If your conda environments are not showing up in Jupyter notebook, you probably do not have nb_conda_kernels 
installed in the environment where Jupyter is installed. Anaconda's 
documentation states that 

nb_conda_kernels should be installed in the environment from which you run Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. This might be your base conda environment, but it need not be. For instance, if the environment notebook_env contains the notebook package, then you would run

{% highlight js %}
conda install -n notebook_env nb_conda_kernels
{% endhighlight %}

### Personal details

Details from this section will be included in your ATAS certificate. Complete 
this carefully and in full, and review it before submitting. Typos and transposed 
numbers are regular mistakes in this area and if the details provided do not 
match the details in your passport exactly, it may affect or delay your visa 
application. Ensure the details of the passport you will use to enter the 
UK are provided in full and are accurate.

### Spouse

If you are married and planning to bring your spouse into the UK, 
you need to enter those details here. If 
your spouse chooses to study or research an ATAS relevant subject while in 
the UK accompanying you, they will need to apply separately for their own 
ATAS certificate.

### Contact details

Make sure your contact details are accurate. The ATAS certificate will 
be sent to the preferred email address you enter in this section.

### Undergraduate/ postgraduate studies

Provide as much detail as possible on all previous undergraduate and 
postgraduate studies you have undertaken. Ensure there are no long gaps 
in your education history. If you were unemployed or, for 
example, a full-time parent, you should indicate this on the form.

### Other studies

If you have undertaken any other studies you think may be relevant to your 
application, you will need to enter it here. If not, fill as NIL.

### Published papers

If you have had any academic or professional papers published, either on 
your own, or with co-publishers, you will need to enter it here.

### Employment history

With as much detail as possible, details of any jobs you have held. You should 
include jobs that relate to your proposed course of study or research area. 
Ensure there are no long gaps in your employment history. If you 
were unemployed or, for example, a full-time parent, you should indicate 
this on the form.

### Referees

Provide details of 2 referees who have known you for a minimum of 3 years. 
At least one of the referees must be from the academic sector. If you have 
work experience, you should include a referee from your employment. A 
referee from your home country would be preferable, but it is not essential 
if you have studied and/or worked in another country. Family members are 
not accepted as referees.

### Financial sponsors

Provide details of sponsors you have for the funding of your proposed studies. 
If you are waiting for a funding decision, include this and note the decision 
is pending. If you are funding your own studies or research, include your name 
and address in the relevant boxes. If another family member is paying for 
your studies, include their details.

Note that the information you provide when you apply is printed on the certificate. 
When you have completed your application, please read through your entries carefully
before you submit it. ATAS team can contact your over email, if they find issues 
with your application.

title: Install PCLPY 0.12.0 in Ubuntu 20.04
categories: General

Many other python libraries tried to bind PCL. The most popular one being `python-pcl`, which uses Cython. While Cython is
really powerful, binding C++ templates isn't one of its strength (and PCL uses templates heavily). The result for
python-pcl is a lot of code repetition, which is hard to maintain and to add features to, and incomplete bindings of
PCL's classes and point types. Using pybind11, we use C++ directly. Templates, boost::smart_ptr and the buffer protocol
are examples of things that are simpler to implement. The results so far are very promising. A large percentage of PCL
is covered.

The follow is the steps to install `pclpy` in Ubuntu 20.04. The document shows it support `python 3.7`, but I was only
successful in installing `pclpy` with `python 3.8`.
